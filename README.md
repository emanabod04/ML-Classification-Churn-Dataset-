# ML-Classification-Churn-Dataset
Project Machine Learning Classification problem using Churn-Dataset using R Language
## About Project 
- Generate a scatterplot matrix to show the relationships between the variables and a heatmap to determine correlated attributes.
- Split the dataset into 80 training, 20 test set and fit a decision tree to the training data. Plot the tree and interpret the results.
- Try different ways to improve the decision tree algorithm (e.g., use different splitting strategies, prune tree after splitting). 
- Classify the data using the XGBoost model with nrounds = 70 and max depth = 3. Evaluate the performance. 
- Train a deep neural network using Keras with 3 dense layers. Try changing the activation function or dropout rate. 
- Compare the performance of the models in terms of the following criteria: precision, recall, accuracy, F-measure. Identify the model that performed best 
and worst according to each criterion
- Use a ROC graph to compare the performance of the DT, XGboost & DNN techniques
